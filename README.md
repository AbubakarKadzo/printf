PRINTF PROJECT	

This is the first group project in the ALX SE done by Vivian and Kadzo

DESCRIPTION	


This is a rather simple replication of the printf function that is supposed to format and print data. This function is part of the standard library and to use it we must specify the header file in the project.
In the folowing project we are expected to write functions that produce output according to a format
In this project conversion specifiers have been delegated as follows:
~ %c  - Prints a single character
~ %s  - Prints a string of characters
~ %%  - Prints a single % to the stream
~ %d  - Prints a signed integer
~ %i  - Prints a signed integer
~ %b  - Prints an unsigned binary
~ %u  - Prints unsigned integers
~ %x  - Prints unsigned hexadecimal integers(lowercase)
~ %X  - Prints unsigned hexadecimal integers(uppercase)
~ %r  - Prints a reversed string
~ %R  - Prints the Rot13 string interpretation

COMPILATION AND USAGE

Compilation
~ All of the files are to be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
~ Code compilation is done with gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c
~ Include the main.h header file on the functions
